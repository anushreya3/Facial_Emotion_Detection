# Facial_Emotion_Detection
Human emotion detection is implemented in many areas requiring additional security or information about the person. It can be seen as a second step to face detection 
where we may be required to set up a second layer of security, where along with the face, the emotion is also detected. The objective of this research is to produce an
automatic facial emotion detection system to identify different emotions based on these experiments the system could identify several people that are sad, surprised,
and happy, in fear, are angry, etc.
